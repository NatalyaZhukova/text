      To define a property in a bean class, supply public getter and setter methods. For example, the following methods define an int property called mouthWidth:   
###
public class FaceBean {
    private int mMouthWidth = 90;

    public int getMouthWidth() {
        return mMouthWidth;
    }
    
    public void setMouthWidth(int mw) {
        mMouthWidth = mw;
    }
}
###   
      A builder tool like NetBeans recognizes the method names and shows the mouthWidth property in its list of properties. It also recognizes the type, int, and provides an appropriate editor so the property can be manipulated at design time.   
      This example shows a property than can be read and written. Other combinations are also possible. A read-only property, for example, has a getter method but no setter. A write-only property has a setter method only.   
      A special case for boolean properties allows the accessor method to be defined using is instead of get. For example, the accessor for a boolean property running could be as follows:   
###
public boolean isRunning() {
    // ...
}
